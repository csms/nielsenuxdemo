# Direct manipulation
## Context
Tasks performed many times during an interaction with a webpage, such as adding items to a shopping bag.
* [**100ms**](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/0.1.html) - Limit if you want users to feel like their actions are directly causing something to happen on the screen
* [300ms](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/0.3.html)
* [500ms](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/0.5.html)
* [**1000ms - 1s**](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/1.html) - It feels like the computer is causing the result to appear. Although users notice the short delay, they stay focused on their current train of thought during the one-second interval.
* [1500ms - 1,5s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/1.5.html)
* [3000ms - 3s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/3.html)
* [10000ms - 10s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/10.html)
* [15000ms - 15s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/appear/15.html)

# Busy indicator
## Context
Infrequent tasks during one interaction with a webpage -  like performing first checkout steps.
* [1000ms - 1s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/busyindicator/1.html)
* [**2000ms - 2s**](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/busyindicator/2.html) (Between 2-10 progress bar may be overkill)
* [3000ms - 3s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/busyindicator/3.html)
* [5000ms - 5s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/busyindicator/5.html)
* [**10000ms - 10s**](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/busyindicator/10.html) - The average attention span is maxed out. At that point, the user's mind starts wandering and doesn't retain enough information in short-term memory to easily resume the interaction once the computer finally loads the next screen.
* [15000ms - 15s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/busyindicator/15.html)

# Progress bar
Very infrequent tasks during one interaction with a webpage - like performing an online payment or loading an application.
* [1000ms - 1s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/progressbar/1.html)
* [1500ms - 1,5s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/progressbar/1.5.html)
* [5000ms - 5s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/progressbar/5.html)
* [**10000ms - 10s**](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/progressbar/10.html) (Progress bar should be used)
* [15000ms - 15s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/progressbar/15.html)
* [30000ms - 30s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/progressbar/30.html)
* [60000ms - 60s](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/csms/nielsenuxdemo/master/progressbar/60.html)
